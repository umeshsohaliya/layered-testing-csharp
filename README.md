# Instructions

## The Task

This repository contains a tiny fragment of a real-life project. We have changed class and interface names to protect the real project. The code is in C# using .NET 5.0.

You have been asked to have a look at class `LegacyCalculator` and find ways for how its implementation could be improved. You are given a time box of 1 hour.

To get started, create a clone or fork of this repository in your Github account which we can then use for the technical interview.

There is no right or wrong answer. You won't find the solution for this task using Google. The key goal is to improve the class `LegacyCalculator` and/or the tests in class `LegacyCalculatorTests`.

In the technical interview we will discuss the improvements that you have identified and implemented. Make sure that all test pass at all times, e.g. by running `dotnet test` in the folder containing the solution file.

## Prerequisites

To work on this task you can use any IDE that supports C#. You will need a recent .NET 5.0 SDK installed on your computer.

Free IDE include:
- VS Code with suitable extensions for .NET / C# (most recent stable release)
- Visual Studio Community Edition (most recent stable release)

## Other Files in Repository

This repository also has files related to a dev container. These files are located in folder `.devcontainer`. You are welcome to use the dev container if you like. 

If you are not familiar with dev containers, you can safely ignore the content of the folder `.devcontainer`. Whether you use the dev container or not has no impact on the outcome of the technical assessment.
